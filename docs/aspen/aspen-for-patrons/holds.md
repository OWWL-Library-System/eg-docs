## Placing a hold
Place a hold to have physical materials sent from another library to your local library for pick up, to reserve a copy available at your local library, and to reserve a copy when all copies are currently unavailable.

You can also place a hold on unavailable digital content directly from the catalog.

You'll need to sign in to your account before you can place a hold. You can sign in before performing a search for a title to place on hold. If you attempt to place a hold before you have signed in, you will be prompted to sign in first.

**To place a hold**, first perform a catalog search. You can place a hold either from the search results screen or from a title's record.

Click on the *Place Hold* button next to the format of the title you'd like to place on hold. If there are multiple editions of the title available, you can place a hold on a specific edition. View the editions for a specific format by clicking the *Show Editions* button. Then, click on the *Place Hold* button next to the specific edition you'd like to request.

After clicking the *Place Hold* button, a popup will appear with additional hold options (unless you have turned on the setting to *Bypass pickup location prompt when placing holds in your account*). If you are placing a hold on physical materials, this popup will populate with your default hold notification preferences. Verify your pickup library and how you would like to be notified of the hold's availability. Then, click the popup's *Place Hold* button.

If you are placing a hold on a digital title, enter your email address to be notified when the title is available for you. Then, click the popup's *Place Hold* button.

If you see a failure message, please contact your library for assistance.
