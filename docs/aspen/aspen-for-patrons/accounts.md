### Checked Out Titles
Use this page to view and manage the titles you have checked out. You can view all of your checked out items, or select from tabs at the top to view only checked out Physical Materials or checked out OverDrive titles. You can also use the *Sort by* dropdown menu to sort your checked out titles.

To access this page, click on the *Checked Out* box on your Account Summary page or select *Checked Out Titles* (or a subpage) from the left sidebar.
#### Renewing borrowed materials

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dl0nxg9Ct0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Most library loans can be renewed. You can do so at the library by asking staff or online from your account. There are a few things to know about renewals:
- Most, but not all, items allow two renewals. If eligible for renewal, the Renew button will be active. If not eligible for renewal, a message will replace the button letting you know that the title cannot be renewed.
- All physical materials that are eligible for renewal are also eligible for autorenewal. Our system will attempt to renew your eligible physical materials on their due date. If you have an email address on your account, you will be sent an email letting you know whether the autorenewal attempt was successful.
- Titles cannot be renewed when there are holds waiting.
- Titles can be renewed even if your account has fines over $5 or more than 5 overdue items.
- Renew your materials close to the due date. Renewals do not add an extra loan period to the end of the current due date, but start a new loan period at the renewal time. Because our system attempts to autorenew your physical materials on their due dates, you may not want to manually renew them.
- If you have a problem with renewing loans online, please contact your local library for assistance.

**To renew your items**, you should first access your account and then you should access your list of Checked Out Titles. Then, either:
- Press the *Renew* button next to a title you'd like to renew.
- Check the checkboxes at the top-left for multiple titles and press the *Renew Selected Items* button at the bottom.
- Press the *Renew All* button at the bottom if you'd like to renew all titles on the page.

### Titles on Hold
Use this page to view the status of titles you have on hold and to manage your holds. Just like with Checked Out Titles, you can see all of your titles on hold or select tabs to view only holds on Physical Materials or OverDrive titles. 

To access this page, click on the *Holds* or *Ready for Pickup* box on your Account Summary page or select *Titles on Hold* (or a subpage) from the left sidebar.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dfsRtFGOlWc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The library takes seriously the privacy of your library records. Therefore, we do not keep track of what you borrow after you return it. However, our automated system has a feature called "My Reading History" that allows you to track items you check out. Participation in the feature is entirely voluntary. You may start or stop using it, as well as delete any or all entries in "My Reading History" at any time. If you choose to start recording "My Reading History," you agree to allow our automated system to store this data. The library staff does not have access to your "My Reading History", however, it is subject to all applicable local, state, and federal laws, and under those laws, could be examined by law enforcement authorities without your permission. If this is of concern to you, you should not use the "My Reading History" feature.

To access this feature, sign in to your account and click the *Reading History* link in the left sidebar.

**To opt in to using the Reading History feature**, press the *Start Recording My Reading History* button. Both Physical Materials and OverDrive titles will be recorded. Only loans from the point you press the button and onwards will be recorded.

**To delete titles from your recorded history**, either:
- Press the *Delete* button next to the title.
- Press the *Delete All* button at the top of the screen.

**To stop recording your history**, press the *Stop Recording My Reading History* button at the top of the screen. Please note that all records will be deleted.
