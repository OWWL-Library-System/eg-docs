# Patrons
### Card eligibility & home libraries
   * Libraries must issue cards to any In-system patron who does not already have an OWWL card. Patrons are allowed one OWWL account only. Issuing cards to out-of-system residents is at the discretion of individual libraries.
   * Libraries get to decide if they assign themselves as the patron’s home library or another library as determined by stat cats. By default, the home library is the library that issues the card. If a library would prefer to issue cards and change patrons' home library to the appropriate library as determined by stat cats, they may do so and should adopt a local policy delineating their process for issuing cards.
   * Libraries are always required to honor requests to change home library for patrons within their service area. (EAC 12/2024, OWWLDAC 01/2025)

### In-system vs. Out-of-system patrons

The OWWL Library System service area is defined as being formed by the counties of Wyoming, Livingston, Ontario, and Wayne in the state of New York.

In-system patrons are all full and part-time residents (whether permanently or temporarily, such as college students), as well as any person who attends school or pays property taxes, within the four county area or in a member library's chartered to serve area. This includes residents of "unserved" communities, or, those communities within the geographic boundary of the OWWL Library System, but outside of an OWWL Library System member library's chartered to serve area, subject to the Free Direct Access policy.

(OWWLAC 05/2018; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022; EAC 08/2024; OWWLDAC 09/2024)

### Out-of-system Patron Statistical Categories

The Residency and School Code statistical categories include areas that are out side of, but border the four OWWL counties and/or share school districts with OWWL communities. For these areas and school districts, select the appropriate codes. For all patrons who live in non-contiguous areas, use the "OOS" code from the Residency and School District lists. This information is necessary to determine the use of library resources by neighboring communities for taxing and free direct access purposes. (OWWLAC, 5/22/2012, 2/2014, 5/2018; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Online Library Card Registration Policy

The [[%ATTACHURL%/Online Library Card Registration Policy - Adopted.pdf][Online Library Card Registration Policy - Adopted.pdf]] affirms that online library card registration is available to all full and part-time residents of Ontario, Wayne, Wyoming, and Livingston Counties as well as any person who attends school or pays property taxes in these counties. Out-of-system self-registration forms will not be processed. (EAC 10/2020; PLSDAC 11/2020)

### Standard patron registration form

A standard registration form is available to download from: Evergreen.PatronsRegistrationFormPrintable. Member libraries may use the form and customize it as necessary. (OWWLAC, 2/22/2006, 1/2014, 05/2018; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Registration paperwork retention

EAC recommends keeping registration paperwork for no longer than is reasonable for local workflow (i.e. time it takes to enter all data into the system) and recommends the proper disposal of registration paperwork, i.e. shredding.

If local library records retention policy indicates retaining paper forms for any length of time, they should be stored securely. Scanning and saving documents electronically is one method used by libraries for secure, long term storage. If libraries retain registration forms in any capacity, security of these forms is the responsibility of the library. (OWWLAC, 3/2005, 4/2005, 2/2014, 10/2014, 05/2018; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Driver's license in patron account

Driver's licenses are not to be added to patron records in Evergreen. There is no option to add driver's license number in a dedicated field, nor should this data be added in any other area in the patron record. (OWWLAC 10/2014, PLS Policy 1/2015)

Libraries may include driver's license numbers in their paper registration files, security of these files is the responsibility of the library.

### Updates to patron accounts

Changing home library, address, library card number, etc. does not necessitate completely new registration. If a patron’s home library or address has changed, the updating library should change the residency code, school code, home library, and hold pickup library as necessary. (OWWLAC, 2/2014; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Patron has a name change

Changes to a patron’s legal name or preferred name can be made based on local library policy. (OWWLAC, 2/2014; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Agency cards

Cards may be issued to specific types of agencies for use by authorized agency staff persons, according to the guidelines laid out in the Evergreen.PatronsAgencyUserRecords page and agreement. Classroom teachers should be referred to their school librarian/BOCES for group loans. (Unknown origin; updated EAC 06/2023; OWWLDAC 09/2023)

### Account expiration

Patron accounts will expire every two years; staff must verify and update contact information before extending another two years. (OWWLAC, 10/2004, 1/2014)

Patrons with email accounts will receive a pre-expiration email notice, alerting them to contact the library to extend their library privileges. (OWWLAC, 1/2014)

### Expired accounts marked inactive

Patron accounts that have been Expired for more than 3 years will be marked "Inactive" automatically by the system. The accounts will be flagged with an Alert stating the reason for being marked inactive, and remain in the database should the patrons return to the library. (OWWLAC, 2/2014)

### Deleting expired accounts

Patron records that have been expired for 6 years will be deleted, including outstanding bills. (OWWLAC, 9/2014; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)

### Renew patron account privilege

Patron accounts may be renewed in person, over the phone, or by email as per the individual library's local policy (OWWLAC, 1/22/2013; 1/2014; EAC 12/2021; PLSDAC 01/2022)
