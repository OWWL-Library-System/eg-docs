# Bills and payments
### Fine forgiveness

Libraries may choose to ignore and override overdue fines, accept payment for overdue fines, or forgive overdue fines according to their local policy. (OWWLDAC 09/2024)

### Payment for items checked out policy

Libraries should not accept payment (whether actual payment or fine forgiveness) for bills on open circulations. (OWWLDAC 09/2024)

### Amnesty Mode

Amnesty mode should not be used in place of going fine-free and should not be used unless in extenuating circumstances. (OWWLDAC 09/2024)

### Lost Materials and Damaged Materials

Bills for lost and damaged materials may be paid at any library but the payment must be forwarded to the owning library.
   * Lost/damaged bills are paid using the Payment Type "Work" to clarify accounting at the payment library.
   * If being paid by check, the check must be addressed to the library receiving payment.
   * Checks and cash should not be sent via OWWL delivery and should be forwarded to the owning library using other means, such as by mail.
   * Payment for lost item processing fees should also be forwarded to the owning library. Forgiveness of lost item processing fees can be determined by the owning library.
   * Check with the owning library before telling a patron that you can accept a replacement copy in lieu of payment. Not all libraries accept replacement copies for lost or damaged items.

### Payments accepted for lost/damaged items owned by another library

Any library may accept payment for any other libraries' lost or damaged materials, but the payment must be forwarded to the owning library. (OWWLAC 04/2014; EAC 04/2022; PLSDAC 05/2022)

### Lost Materials Processing Fee bills

If a library charges processing fees in addition to lost materials bills, then the library should roll the fee into the item price or use the system-generated Lost Materials Processing Fee bill. No libraries should create manual bills, after the fact. Contact PLS to configure the system-generated processing fee bill. (01/2014)

### Overdue fines

Bills for overdue materials may be paid at any library and the bill payment kept by that library regardless of where the materials were checked out, where the materials were checked in, or who owns the materials. (11/2013)

### "Forgive" payment type

When not holding a patron responsible for a fine, for whatever reason, use the "Forgive" payment type to clear the fine; add an annotation to attach relevant explanatory notes. (11/2013)

### "Credit"

Libraries should not convert excess payment into credit. (OWWLAC 09/2012, 11/2013)
