# Administration
### Report processing schedule

EAC recommends following the report processing schedule and to take appropriate action as indicated on the schedule to maintain accurate patron and item records and to provide good customer service. (EAC 04/2024; OWWLDAC 05/2024)

### Shelving locations
Libraries should be consistent in the naming conventions they use for shelving locations. Shelving locations should use Title Case and should be of a reasonable length. Shelving locations should be added sparingly and should ideally correspond with an actual physical shelving location. (EAC 12/2023, OWWLDAC 02/2024)

### Circulation policy modifications

Requests for changes to a library's circulation policies in Evergreen should come from or CC the library's director. Library directors may appoint a designee for circulation policy updates; this designee may request circulation policy changes without CC'ing the library director. (EAC 10/2023; OWWLDAC 12/2023)

### Grievances

If OWWL policies are abused, all library staff and directors should follow the EAC Grievance Policy and Procedure.
