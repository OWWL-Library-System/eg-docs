# Cataloging and items
## Item management
### Deletion of items

Items with particular statuses will be deleted from Evergreen by System staff on the following schedule:
   * Missing items three years after last status update
   * Lost and paid items six months after last status update
   * Lost items when patron is deleted
Libraries are encouraged to delete items sooner according to local policy. (OWWLDAC 09/2024)

### Deletion of lost items

Items that are marked lost should not be deleted. First post a forgive payment to the patron's account so the item is marked as lost and paid, then delete the item. (EAC 10/2024; OWWLDAC 11/2024)
## Cataloging
### VHS

PLS does not accept requests to create new title records for VHS materials (with the exception of local history materials). (OWWLAC 04/2014; EAC 06/2022)

### Older titles

PLS reserves the right to refuse new title record requests for older titles.

Libraries should carefully review materials prior to request to ensure that they are still accurate, relevant, and appropriate for the collection. (OWWLAC 04/2014)

### Close enough records

PLS Cataloging will combine in the same title record multiple editions when the essential work is the same, but the specific copy varies in minor details. For example: hard cover and trade paperback editions of the same title, books with included discussion guide materials, differing publishers or distributors, etc. (OWWLAC 05/2012, 04/2014)

### Multiple format combinations

PLS Cataloging will combine formats in a single title record when the combined formats are essential to the use of the material. For example: books with accompanying computer discs. (OWWLAC 04/2014)
