# Circulation configuration

## Circulation limits
Libraries can ask to set circulation limits in Evergreen. These limits automatically control how many items with a specific circulation modifier a patron can borrow at one time.

Circulation limits:

- Apply to **all items** with the circulation modifier checked out at the library (including items from other libraries fulfilling holds).
- Include items already checked out at the limiting library.
- Do **not** include items checked out from another library.
- Are not tied to the patronâ€™s home library.
- **Can** be overridden by the library, such as for holds.

## Alert Message

Staff can override checkout limits. This decision is up to each library. Once a limit is overridden, **all additional items will check out.**

## Requesting Circulation Limits

Library directors can email evergreen@pls-net.org to request circulation limits.
